# Don't forget to check out the Spark UI at http://localhost:4040/jobs/
# Every time a new invoice is being produced in kafka, spark structured streaming will read it and flatten it.
# The output will appear at the 'output' folder, but you can also have a look at the Spark UI in your browser

# Don't forget to delete the chk-point-dir, kafka-logs and output directories once you're done.
